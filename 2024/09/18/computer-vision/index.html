                <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>In recent years, with the rapid development of computer vision and deep learning technology, image classification and object detection have made remarkable progress, and have been widely used in many fields. One important application is wildlife monitoring, where the identification and tracking of various species plays a vital role in conservation efforts.<br>In this context, our research focuses on the challenging task of image classification and target detection on the “Penguins vs Turtles” dataset [1] provided by the well-known platform Kaggle.<br>The main goal of our research is twofold: First, using advanced machine learning algorithms, images are accurately classified into two different categories, namely penguins and turtles, based on their visual characteristics.  Successful completion of these missions will not only contribute to the scientific understanding of wildlife, but will also pave the way for intelligent systems that can effectively assist conservationists and researchers in monitoring and protecting these species.<br>The “Penguins vs Turtles” dataset is an outstanding resource curated for the Kaggle community and contains a large number of annotated images showing penguins and turtles in their natural habitat. Each image is carefully labeled to indicate whether penguins or turtles are present in it, facilitating supervised learning methods for classification and object detection. The diversity and complexity of this dataset presents both exciting challenges and great opportunities for developing robust and accurate models.<br>In this article, we describe the methods and results of handling the above tasks. We delve into the complex details of our chosen deep learning architecture, dataset preprocessing techniques, and optimization strategies. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive experiment to analyze the performance of our model and compare it with the most advanced methods. By sharing our insights and findings, we hope to contribute to common knowledge in the field of image classification and target detection, while demonstrating the importance of these applications in the field of wildlife conservation.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Review</strong><br>  Image classification and object detection are basic tasks in computer vision and have many applications in wildlife monitoring, autonomous driving and robotics. Over the years, researchers have developed various techniques to address these challenges, each with its own unique advantages and limitations. In this section, we will review the relevant literature on image classification and object detection.</p>
<p><em><strong>image classification</strong></em><br>  Image classification is designed to assign a label or category to an input image from a predefined set of categories. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have played a key role in revolutionizing image classification because of their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from data. Earlier work, such as AlexNet[2] and VGG[3], demonstrated the effectiveness of deep CNNS in large-scale image classification tasks, achieving top performance in well-known benchmarks such as ImageNet. Since then, many improvements have been made to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the image classification model. GoogLeNet[4], ResNet[5], and DenseNet[6] are notable architectures that introduce techniques such as jump joins, residual learning, and dense joins, respectively, to deal with disappearing gradients and help train extremely deep networks.</p>
<p><em><strong>object detection</strong></em><br>  Object detection involves identifying and locating multiple objects of interest in an image. Traditional object detection methods, such as sliding window methods and Haar-like features, have limitations for dealing with complex scenes with different sizes and orients.<br>Region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) [7] work by introducing the concept of regional proposals generated by selective searches and then processing these regions through CNN-based classifications. The method involves extracting regional proposals from input images and feeding them into CNNS one by one for feature extraction and classification. Although effective, RCNN needs to process a large number of regional proposals independently and has a high computational overhead, making it less practical in real-time applications.<br>Fast R-CNN[8] is an improvement on RCNN that addresses its efficiency issues by introducing several key improvements. Fast R-CNN no longer handles each regional proposal independently, but shares the convolutional features of all regional proposals. This shared feature extraction significantly reduces computational time and increases the overall speed of the model. In addition, a Region of Interest (ROI) pooling layer is introduced to align features extracted from irregularly shaped region proposals into a fixed-size feature map, which is convenient for classification in the fully connected layer. The Fast R-CNN achieved significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency over its predecessor.<br>Building on the success of Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN[9] proposes a ground-breaking and innovative approach to integrating Regional proposal networks (RPNS) into the target detection process. RPN generates regional proposals as an integral part of the end-to-end training process, making the model a fully convolutional structure and significantly faster than previous methods. Faster R-CNN uses a two-stage approach: First, the RPN generates candidate regions with bounding box proposals, which are then fed into the subsequent target detection network for classification and bounding box coordinate fine-tuning. RPNS are trained to predict anchor boxes that tightly enclose instances of objects, and these predictions are used to sort and filter regional proposals based on the likelihood of containing objects. Integrating RPN with Faster R-CNN proved to be highly effective, showing state-of-the-art performance across multiple target detection benchmarks.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong><br>In this section, we detail the methods used to solve image classification and target detection tasks in the “Penguins vs Turtles” dataset. Both missions use the Faster R-CNN architecture, which performs well in target detection benchmarks and has real-time processing capabilities.<br>Faster R-CNN is a major advance in the field of object detection, combining the advantages of regional proposal networks and convolutional neural networks in an end-to-end framework, greatly reducing the amount of computation by sharing the feature layer, thus increasing the detection speed of the algorithm. Key components of Faster R-CNN include the Regional Proposal Network (RPN) and the subsequent target detection network.<br>RPN generates regional proposals by predicting anchor boxes that tightly surround potential target instances. These anchor frames serve as reference areas with different scales and aspect ratios to propose candidate areas containing targets. The RPN shares convolution features with the target detection network to form a unified, computationally efficient model. The object detection network inputs the RPN-generated area proposal, classiifies it to determine the presence of the target, and performs regression to fine-tune the bounding box coordinates. Use ROI pooling to adapt and align RPN feature maps to generate fixed-size feature vectors for efficient and accurate classification and regression. </p>

<p><em><strong>Backbone network</strong></em><br>Faster R-CNN can adopt a variety of backbone feature extraction networks, such as VGG, Resnet, Xception, etc. In this paper, Resnet50 network is adopted. Resnet network is a kind of deep residual network, which directly introduces the data output of a certain layer of the previous layers into the input part of the later data layer, which means that a part of the content of the later feature layer will be linearly contributed by a certain layer of the previous. Deep residual network can effectively solve the problem that the learning efficiency decreases and the accuracy cannot be effectively improved due to the deepening of network depth. </p>
<img src="/2024/09/18/computer-vision/Resnet.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload class title="Resnet">

<p>Resnet50 has two basic blocks, namely Conv Block and Identity Block. The dimensions of input and output of Conv Block are different, so they cannot be connected continuously. Its function is to change the dimension of the network. Can be connected in series to deepen the network.</p>
<p><em><strong>region proposal networks</strong></em><br>RPN(Region Proposal Networks) networks are regional nomination networks that take an image of any size as input and output a set of rectangular target proposals with targeted scores.<br>To generate the region proposal, we slide a small network onto the convolutional feature map of the output of the last shared convolutional layer. This small network takes an n×n spatial window as input, where n is a parameter. Each sliding window is mapped to a low-dimensional feature, which is then activated by ReLU[10]. This feature is entered into two parallel fully connected layers, one for regression and one for classification. In this article, we use n &#x3D; 3. </p>
<img src="/2024/09/18/computer-vision/RPN.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload class title="RPN">

<p>Each grid has three size prediction boxes, and each prediction box has three ratios, respectively 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1. Then each prediction box is classified by grid, and the prior box and the real box respectively correspond to a central coordinate point and a group width. The weight in the RPN network is adjusted by learning the difference between the prior box and the real box. Finally, it is used to predict the position of objects. It is worth noting that since the small network operates in a sliding window fashion, the fully connected layer is shared across all spatial locations. This architecture is naturally implemented by an n×n convolution layer, followed by two parallel 1×1 convolution layers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Loss function</strong></em><br> To train the RPN, we assign each anchor a binary class label (indicating whether it is an object or not). We assign positive category tags to two types of anchors: (i) An anchor with the highest IoU overlap with any ground-truth bounding box, or (ii) an anchor with an IoU overlap greater than 0.7 with any ground-truth bounding box. Note that a single ground-truth bounding box may assign positive category labels to multiple anchor points. In general, the second condition is sufficient to determine the positive sample; However, in order to ensure that positive samples can be found in some rare cases, we still use the first condition. For all non-positive sample anchor points with an IoU ratio less than 0.3 to the ground-truth bounding box, we assign them as negative category labels. An anchor point that is neither a positive nor a negative sample contributes nothing to the training goal.<br>According to the above definition, we train the RPN by minimizing an objective function that follows the multitask loss in Fast R-CNN. Specifically, the objective function is defined as:</p>
<img src="/2024/09/18/computer-vision/loss_function.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload class title="loss_function">

<p>For bounding boxes, we use the following four parameterization methods:</p>
<img src="/2024/09/18/computer-vision/boundin_box.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload class title="boundin_box">

<p>Where x, y, w, and h represent the center coordinates and width and height of the bounding box, respectively. The variables x, , and represent prediction bounding boxes, anchor bounding boxes, and ground-truth bounding boxes, respectively (the same goes for y, w, and h). This can be seen as a bounding box regression from an anchor bounding box to a nearby ground-truth bounding box.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental results</strong><br>In this section, we describe the experimental setup used to evaluate the performance of the “Faster R-CNN” model for image classification and target detection on the “Penguins vs Turtles” dataset. We describe data set statistics, training configurations, evaluation metrics, and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the results.</p>
<p><em><strong>Data preprocess</strong></em><br>Due to the limitation of the computer hardware device (GPU), the image is uniformly adjusted to the input size of 256x256 and normalized during data preprocessing.<br>In addition, in target detection task, the bounding box annotation format given by “Penguins vs Turtles” data set is[, , , ], which is not easy to draw the bounding box. Therefore. We set the target of the model to [, , , ]，and the label is converted once during data preprocessing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Train configuration</strong></em><br>For the construction of “Faster R-CNN” model, we use PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, and use ResNet50 pre-trained model as the backbone network for feature extraction. The models were trained on the “Penguins vs Turtles” dataset, and the RPN and the target detection network were jointly optimized using the SGD optimizer. The optimizer is set to a learning rate of 0.001, trains 20 epochs, and saves the epoch that works best based on the evaluation metrics on the validation set. </p>

During the training of the network, we saved the epoch with the best effect on target recognition according to the average IoU of the model on the verification set. The IoU of the training set and the verification set of this model on the “Penguins vs Turtles” data set and the distance between the center of the prediction box and the center of the real box are shown in Table 2.<br>            IoU     	Distance<br>Train set	0.8971  	3.6045<br>Valid set	0.8775  	4.9678</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong><br>Our experimental results for image classification and target detection on the “Penguins vs Turtles” dataset using the “Faster R-CNN” network perform well, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of this approach. In this section, we discuss experimental results, method performance, and possible causes of observed failures.<br>The “Faster R-CNN” model shows excellent performance in image classification and target detection tasks. For image classification, the model achieves an accuracy of 0.9306 on the validation set, effectively distinguishing penguins and turtles based on visual features. The high accuracy indicates that the model has the ability to accurately predict and correctly classify images. In the target detection task, the “Faster R-CNN” model achieved an average IoU score of 0.8775 on the validation set. It reflects the model’s ability to accurately locate and classify penguins and turtles in images.<br>However, the real-time performance of “Faster R-CNN” is poor, because the model is larger, the parameters are more numerous, and the calculation process is more complicated. This model has excellent accuracy, but also makes the calculation rate is relatively low, the calculation time is long, no matter in the process of training or reasoning, it needs to consume a long time.<br>In addition, in this experiment, in the classification task, the model pays more attention to the posture of the object. As shown in Figure, when the movement and posture of the penguin are the same as that of the turtle, the model will recognize the penguin as a turtle, but will not recognize the penguin from the consideration of skin color and background.</p>

<p>In the task of target recognition, although the model has been able to detect the location of the target well and generate a reasonable detection frame for it, in terms of details, the model is more inclined to generate a small target detection frame. As shown in the Figure, the model does not completely frame the edge part of the hand and foot of the object.</p>

<p>For the above problems, we have also made corresponding explanations. Some possible reasons for the error include: a. Limited data sets: Despite the diversity of the Penguins vs Turtles dataset, it is possible that underrepresentation of certain species can lead to misclassification. b. Small or distant objects: Detection of small or distant objects can be challenging, especially if the object features are not obvious, which can lead to missing or inaccurate bounding boxes for detection.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>In this study, we explore the application of the “Faster R-CNN” architecture to image classification and target detection tasks on the “Penguins vs Turtles” dataset. The results show that the Faster R-CNN model performs well in both tasks, achieving high accuracy for image classification tasks and achieving significant average IoU scores for object detection tasks. This work has important implications for wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts, as accurately classifying and locating penguins and turtles provides valuable insights into the field of wildlife ecology.<br>Effectiveness: Faster R-CNN shows robustness and efficiency in image classification and target detection tasks. Combining area suggestion network (RPN) with object detection network helps to achieve real-time capability and high accuracy of the model.<br>Limitations: Models face challenges in detecting small or distant objects, as well as environmental occlusion. This can lead to potentially erroneous negative results and inaccuracies in bounding box predictions.<br>Recommendations for future work: To further improve the performance of the Faster R-CNN model and address the observed limitations, future work could focus on the following areas:<br>Data enhancement and collection: Enhance the dataset with more diverse transformations and collect additional data with a balanced distribution of categories and various environmental conditions to enhance the generalization of the model.<br>Hyperparameter tuning: Performing extensive hyperparameter tuning allows you to optimize model performance and adjust parameters for better results.<br>Integrated approach: By combining predictions from multiple models or architectures, you can improve overall performance and enhance robustness.<br>Transfer learning: Using models pre-trained on larger and more diverse datasets for transfer learning helps models gain knowledge from related tasks and improve performance.<br>Advanced object Detection architectures: Studying other state-of-the-art object detection architectures, such as YOLO or SSDS, may provide valuable insights and potentially improve performance.</p>
